            <p>Loki is an absolutely charming bundle of energy, ready to infuse your life with boundless enthusiasm! He's an adventurous spirit who adores exploring the great outdoors and stretching his legs, making him the perfect companion for all your hiking adventures. He's a pro when it comes to walking on a harness and a lead. If you're up for it, helping him improve his recall would be a rewarding endeavour however for the time being he is happy walking on a long line and exploring his surrounding that way.

              Loki's journey began in Greece as a puppy, and he's likely a mix of Collie and guardian breeds. He often showcases these traits, like being quite vocal and attuned to his surroundings, especially when people pass by the house or neighbours get a bit noisy in their gardens. That's why he dreams of a serene, rural setting where he can bask in the soothing sounds of nature, leaving the noisy hustle and bustle of city life behind.
              
              As for his size, Loki doesn’t realize just how big he is, so he's better suited to households with older children who can keep up with his exuberance. He thrives as the sole dog in the family and prefers a cat-free environment.
              
              Loki is an avid toy enthusiast, and a game of tuggy is his idea of the best thing ever! Plus, he's perfectly content entertaining himself, tossing the ball around when you're occupied with other tasks. He is also very determined when it comes to destroying his toys so a large toy box is a must!
              
              Please note that Loki requires a special diet due to allergies so new owners must be able to accommodate this.
              
              If you think that Loki would fit in with your family and you have the environment that he needs we’d love to hear from you.
